# user-controller-nodeJs
Using nodeJs(express) to perform hight security user interections

To access api you need to create a DB at MongoDb Atlass or you can use your local DB (You can find configurations at config.env)
At least you need your Atlas Database string connection and your DB password.
You can find my api test at User controller.postman_collection.
After you run the project you can import some users using the command (node ./dev-data/data/import-dev-data.js --import)
