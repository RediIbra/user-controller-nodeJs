# user-controller-nodeJs
Using nodeJs(express) to perform hight security user interections

- To access api you need to create a DB at MongoDb Atlass or you can use your local DB (You can find configurations at config.env) <br/>
- At least you need your Atlas Database string connection and your DB password. <br/>
- You can find my api test at User controller.postman_collection. <br/>
- After you run the project you can import some users using the command (node ./dev-data/data/import-dev-data.js --import) <br/>
